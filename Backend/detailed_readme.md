## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview & Bottom-Up Design Philosophy

### Core Design Principles

**Bottom-Up Approach**: This project is structured to build foundational components first, ensuring that later phases require minimal changes to core functionality. Each layer builds upon the previous one without requiring architectural overhauls.

**Architectural Layers** (Bottom to Top):
1. **Foundation Layer**: Core entities, security configuration, database setup
2. **Data Access Layer**: Repositories, DTOs, data validation
3. **Integration Layer**: External API wrappers, third-party service clients
4. **Service Layer**: Business logic, orchestration services
5. **Presentation Layer**: REST controllers, frontend components

**Key Benefits**:
- Minimal refactoring required in later phases
- Stable foundation for feature expansion
- Clear separation of concerns
- Scalable architecture ready for microservices transition
