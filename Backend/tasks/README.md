## Task File Structure

Each task file follows a consistent template:

1. **Scope / Objective** - What needs to be built and why
2. **Prerequisites & Dependencies** - Required completed tasks and setup
3. **Technical Specifications** - Technologies and architectural decisions
4. **Step-by-Step Implementation Guide** - Detailed implementation steps (15-30 minutes each)
5. **Code Examples & References** - Skeleton code and implementation patterns
6. **Testing Requirements** - Specific tests to write and validation steps
7. **Acceptance Criteria** - Definition of done checklist
8. **Best Practices Reminders** - Security, performance, and quality guidelines

## Implementation Approach

### Bottom-Up Architecture
The tasks are designed following a bottom-up approach where:
- Foundation components are built first (database, authentication, basic APIs)
- Each layer builds upon the previous without requiring architectural changes
- Later phases extend functionality without refactoring core components

### Junior Developer Friendly
Each task is designed to be:
- **Completable in 2-4 hours** by a junior developer
- **Self-contained** with clear prerequisites and dependencies
- **Well-documented** with code examples and references
- **Testable** with specific validation criteria

### Quality Standards
All tasks emphasize:
- **Security first** - Security considerations built into every component
- **Performance optimization** - Scalable solutions from the start
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Testing** - Test-driven development with comprehensive coverage
- **Documentation** - Clear documentation and code comments

## Getting Started

1. **Review Prerequisites** - Ensure all dependencies are met before starting a task
2. **Follow Step-by-Step Guide** - Complete each step in order with expected outcomes
3. **Implement Code Examples** - Use provided skeleton code as starting points
4. **Write Tests** - Implement all required tests before marking task complete
5. **Validate Acceptance Criteria** - Ensure all checklist items are completed
6. **Document Changes** - Update relevant documentation and code comments

## Dependencies and Critical Path

### Phase 1 Critical Path:
1. Project Setup → Database Design → User Authentication
2. Social Media Integration → Content Management → Scheduling System
3. Frontend Dashboard (can be developed in parallel with backend services)

### Phase 2 Dependencies:
- Analytics System requires Social Media Integration and Content Management
- Video Generation requires Content Management and Media Processing
- Testing & Deployment requires all other components

## Support and Resources

- **Architecture Documentation**: `/Backend/detailed_readme.md`
- **Implementation Notes**: `/Backend/Implementation_notes.md`
- **Code Examples**: Each task file contains relevant code snippets
- **Best Practices**: Security, performance, and quality guidelines in each task

## Quality Gates

Each phase includes quality gates to ensure:
- **Functionality**: All features work as specified
- **Performance**: System meets performance benchmarks
- **Security**: No critical vulnerabilities
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Documentation**: Complete and up-to-date documentation

This task-driven approach ensures systematic, high-quality implementation of the SocialSync platform while providing clear guidance for developers at all skill levels.
